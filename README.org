* TODOs

** Main list (active: [1/16])
*- _Legend_:*
  *[X]* /Started/ongoing/ | *[-]* /On hold/

--------------

- [ ] Implement deploying configs
- [ ] Implement generating default =settings.conf= ?
- [X] Allow set/unset/get settings through flags
  - Set any defaults?
- [ ] Allow globbing in inclusion list?
- [ ] Add --force flag to allow clobbering if repo file is newer than src
- [ ] Move dir exist check from copy_all() -> mk_dst_dirs()
- [ ] Split  ~mk_dst_dirs()~ so ~-t~ can check dst paths are valid, sans mkdir
- [ ] Add a function to check the error arrays at the end of all runs
- [ ] Automate updating man-page source & generating a new one
- [-] Write a good-enough menu for 'interactive'-mode
- [ ] Allow multiple inclusion sources
  - [ ] Nested list input handling (i.e "per-app" lists and dir trees)
- [ ] (Maybe) Implement a small error stack just in case it becomes untrivial
  later
- [ ] Allow error verbosity levels
  - Rework after 'proper' arg parsing is implemented
- [ ] Allow saving existing target root as =dir.old/=
  - Allow setting for gzip if repo is large enough to warrant compression?
- [ ] Let user keep a machine/account-local ignore file that matches
  against the include list, suppressing warnings about those files not
  being on the local machine
- [ ] Do =pushd= & =popd= on start and end of run
  - Try to find out if it'll ever be necessary first. /Upd.:/ Probably
    not :)
*** Completed [2/2]
- [X] Update README after moving to own repo
- [X] Rename, restructure, and fork off updater & man generator
